This repository is a collection of all of the embedded projects that I worked on over the course of the summer including but not limited to working with rotary potentiometers, 
heat and motion sensors, LEDs, segment displays, etc. These four months of working on these projects have allowed me to both learn the interfacing of hardware and software as
well as experimenting with the esp32 and try all sorts of differnet functionalities of the board and creating some personal projects.
